Mint.com Keyboard Shortcuts
===========================

Mint.com is great in a number of respects, but somewhat lacking in keyboard shortcuts. 
This user script adds a few simple keyboard shortcuts so you can work with Mint a little faster, in Chrome anyway.

# Installation
1. Clone this repo.
2. In Chrome, go to Window > Extensions
3. Drag the `src/js/mint-keyboard-shortcuts.js` file onto the Chrome window.
4. The script should now be installed, and will run any time you're on Mint's Transactions screen.

# Usage
From the Transactions page on mint.com, you can use the following shortcuts.
